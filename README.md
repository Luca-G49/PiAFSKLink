# PiAFSKLink

PiAFSKLink is a project that uses a Raspberry Pi to transmit and receive AFSK (Audio Frequency Shift Keying) signals. The project is designed for digital radio communication, allowing users to send and receive data over radio frequencies using AFSK modulation.

## Features

- Use a Raspberry Pi to handle AFSK modulation and demodulation.

## How It Works

PiAFSKLink operates by modulating and demodulating data into audio signals using AFSK. The Raspberry Pi handles the entire process, allowing you to interface with any radio device capable of transmitting and receiving audio signals (such as a transceiver with audio input and output).

### 1. **Transmission (AFSK Modulation)**

- The software takes digital data (e.g., text or binary information) and converts it into AFSK-modulated audio signals.
- These audio signals are then transmitted via the audio output of the Raspberry Pi.
- The frequency shifts in the audio correspond to the different binary states of the transmitted data.

### 2. **Reception (AFSK Demodulation)**

- The Raspberry Pi uses its audio input to capture the incoming AFSK signals.
- The software then demodulates the audio signal back into digital data, extracting the transmitted information.
- This data can be displayed on the Raspberry Pi or sent to another system for further processing.
